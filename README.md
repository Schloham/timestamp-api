# Timestamp Microservice for Free Code Camp
This project is to fulfill the requirements for the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/timestamp-microservice">Timestamp Microservice Project</a> on Free Code Camp.

##User Stories:
* I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).  
* If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.  
* If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
